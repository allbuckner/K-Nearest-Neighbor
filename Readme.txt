Programming Assignment 1
CSE 514 Data Mining

My file Test.py is written in python and runs in the command line. Simply start the file with no parameters and the file will open up with prompts. The first prompt will ask for the file path of the training file (make sure this is in the same format as the provided breast-cancer-wisconsin.data file). The next prompt will ask for a k value. It takes integers as valid values. The last prompt will ask for a file path to write the new data into. If an existent file is named, the data will be appended to the bottom of the data in the file. If the file name does not exist, a file will be created in the file path and the data will be added into it. The output data will be formatted in the same way as that in the breast cancer file provided.
Make sure that the "breast-cancer-wisconsin.data" file is within the same folder as the program.
